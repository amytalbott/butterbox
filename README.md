ButterBox isn't a real business, but if it was, this would be its website.

Using the magic of React, I've created a shopping cart function, where users can
add or remove items, and see their totals reflected at the top right corner of the
page.

On the ButterBlog page, I've connected with the WordPress API to pull in blog post
titles, excerpts, and content from a WordPress site I created.

To see this project in action, just clone, then enter npm start.
