ButterBox isn't a real business, but if it was, this would be its website.

This app lets users see ButterBox product details, add and remove items from their shopping cart, and see their totals reflected at the top right corner of the
page.

On the ButterBlog page, I've connected with the WordPress API to pull in blog post
titles, excerpts, and content from a WordPress site I created.

To see this project in action, just clone, then enter npm start.
